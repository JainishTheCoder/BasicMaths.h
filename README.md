# BasicMaths.h
I'm Working on a header file for C/C++ Language.
Using the basicmaths.h header file we can do programs easily like python.
i am making it almost similar to like php maths functions.

if you are interested to make this interesting header file you can also contribute in this project because it is opensourse and this project is under GNU.

After solving problems and adding new functions please send me that header file at - jainishprajapati98@gmail.com

Thank you.......
